Listen..

If He really likes you. Asked you out and you declined.

No grudges but just know you can't be friends or vibe as
you used to. Guys hate the friend zone so He'd rather go
back to being strangers.

Coz He knows what He wants and won't settle for less.
So before you say No, check the worth of your friendship
because that is what you are actually throwing away.

You could still talk but not deep, not frequently. Don't
expect his constant calls or messages. If you need his
help Holla, By all means He will help out but you can't be
besties.

You can call it petty but He doesn't want the torture of
constantly being in communication with someone he
cares deeply for but can't Have. So check again, Do you
still think its petty?

This is what alot of guys do and y'all just conclude its
hate. No, It's not Grudges. Some of them are trying to
heal and forget about you. Let them. No be everybody
wey snub you dey vex. ❤️
