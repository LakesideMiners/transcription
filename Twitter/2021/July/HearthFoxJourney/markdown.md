# START OF TRANSCRIPTION

## START OF PANEL 1
In Middle School I put on a lot of weight.
People started being mean to me.
I had friends but I could feel the attitude of everyone changing around me.

## START OF PANEL 2
I know its a difficult time for everyone but something felt wrong.
I felt so out of place. 
Everyone else seemed to figure it out.
How to interact with each other. 
I felt defective.
I felt isolated.
I was ashamed of my body.
I cried on the bus a lot.


## START OF PANEL 3
When High school came around I got excited!
It felt like a chance for a fresh start.
I could be positive.


## START OF PANEL 4
I was wrong. 
Everything got worse.
Everything felt like it had no meaning.
It was hard to care.
I couldn't make anyone happy.
Not my teachers or you or even myself.
It was just one distraction to pass the time after another.



## START OF PANEL 5
Its important to note that this was all happening emotionally.
Not everything was terrible!
It always felt that way though.
I was sad and numb and jaded, I couldn't imagine a real future for myself. 
I just stuck to theater and my nerdy hobbies.
I drew but not with confidence.
Mostly I just imagined a lot.
Small things that made the world feel softer.



## START OF PANEL 6
I felt like an alien.
I was weird and i didn't fit in.
"Something will change eventually and then I'll feel normal... right?" Was my go to thought.
Someday, I'll get a girlfriend and find a place I belong and figure out what to do with my life. Someday I'll feel like a real person who can do things right.


## START OF PANEL 7
That didn't ever happen.
Instead those "Alien" feelings got more intense.
I was just going with the motions.
I did things I felt like I was expected to do because there was no alternative.
When I did finally find places I felt drawn to I was to scared to pursue them.
I was weird enough inside,  I didn't want you to be mad at me for being strange.
It was like being trapped.  And on top of it all I STILL hated my body.


## START OF PANEL 8
I started watching anime in high school.
It introduced me to the idea of a fandom.  
I connected with people.
We were all weird together!
Eventually I found forums and met more people.
I couldn't make friends with my peers but I could meet people with similar interests.
The best part was my Avatar!
I didn't have to show my face.
I could make one that felt more comfortable.
I could be "Cute"


## START OF PANEL 9
The truth is...
I love cute stuff.
It was weird for guys to like cute things through.
I just started bottling it up and keeping it a secret.
I felt like if people knew I loved soft gentle things they would think I was a pervert or a weirdo.
And it's not just that I like cute..
I wanted to be cute.
I couldn't through.
Not in my body.
That led to more secrets and more hiding.
I was sure that if people found out they would hate me.
I couldn't handle the though of that.


## START OF PANEL 10
I made myself look scary so people would leave me alone.
I secretly felt like I was stuck in the wrong body.
I did whatever I could to cope.
I knew the "gay" kids at school but I saw how people talked about them.
Eventually I got on a forum with other people who felt like me,  I felt like I fit in easier there.
They all felt trapped in the wrong body too.
They all felt like they were animals inside and honestly...
As insane as it sounds...
That made so much sense to me.
I felt like I'd found my explanation.
Of course this meant more secrets,  more space between me and everyone else.


## START OF PANEL 11
I was a Fox.
You already knew that though.
Foxes enchanted me.
They're beautiful and mysterious.
A balance between masculine and feminine.
Cute but dangerous.
Free to be whatever they pleased.
I saw all of this in myself but was unable to explore it outwardly.
So my only option was to hide it,  I spent such a long time this way.
The things I kept hidden away became a second life.
Eventually... like ten years later... I'd grow tired of those people.
Some of them hurt me.
Most of them never grew.
I didn't want to be stagnate and self loathing forever.
I needed to keep looking.
I had a small explanation but it wasn't enough.
I still felt out of place.


## START OF PANEL 12
Eventually I found the Furry fandom!
It was much more welcoming and warm and active and kind!
I could be more like the me I felt inside and feel welcomed and love.
It was huge and overwhelming when I went to my first convention.
I cried from sheer joy for a long time because I had never felt so seen and understood.
I still had to keep this part of me a secret though.
Furries are weird and misunderstood and got hated and made fun of.
I was used to it at that point.
I accepted I'd never be allowed to be me outside of these small pockets.
At least I had friends and something that made me happy.
I still felt like a failure but I could smile and feel warm.


## START OF PANEL 13
The joy was curbed though.  
Even in this new community I was strange.
Nobody here though they were an animal in the wrong body.
There were transgender people but I didn't feel like a women.
I don't know what I felt like... all I had up to that point was "I'm a fox".
I kept all that buried.
I was still a fox but this was just a character now.
A costume I could put on and take off.
But that left the question: "Who am I when I'm not in character?"


## START OF PANEL 14
Then I met J.
I fell stupid hard in love.
It wasn't like any relationship I had before.
I moved in with them and started building a life and trying my best.
I was far away from my family but after all the secrets and self hate and failure I just though nobody would miss me much.
It wasn't the first time I felt that.
I had though of disappearing before but now I had a future to share.
This time was different.
J and I went to conventions and made friends.  In the back of my mind was still "I'm a fox".. I still felt like I was being who I was expected to be.
I've struggled with Anxiety attacks and depression and a low sense of self worth for a long time.
I blamed myself for these Alien/Fox feelings.
I'll be honest... there's alot I've left out.
I want his comic to be a good thing.
I want to share my journey so we can be happy in the present.
I don't want to upset anyone.
I would be lying if I said there was never fighting or anger or pain.  I'd be dishonest if I said there were never times I wanted to stop existing...
There were... a lot... but I have to let you know because it makes the joy I have now all the more special.
I want to share my joy.. but that means sharing some pain as well.
